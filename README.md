## What is BitWHIP

BitWHIP is a CLI WebRTC Agent written in Rust. These are some of the things you can do with it today.

* Publish your desktop with 30ms of latency
* Play the stream in a native player
* Pull WebRTC video from other sources and play
  * [Broadcast Box][broadcast-box-url]
  * [IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/)
  * [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/webrtc-beta/)
  * [Dolby.io](https://docs.dolby.io/streaming-apis/reference/whip_whippublish)
  * [Red5](https://www.red5.net/docs/special/user-guide/whip-whep-configuration/)
  * [Nimble Streamer](https://softvelum.com/nimble/)
  * any services that support [WHIP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wish-whip/)/[WHEP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-murillo-whep/)!

BitWHIP is built on open protocols so should work pretty much anywhere. It should also interop with your
favorite tools and libraries like OBS, FFmpeg or GStreamer.

## Building
BitWHIP uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to make installing dependencies and building easier. To build
this project first you install `just` and then execute `install-deps`.

### Install Just
`cargo install just`

### Install dependencies
`just install-deps`

## Using
Now that you have built you have three different paths.

### Play WHIP

Play WHIP starts a local WHIP server that clients can push too. You can use this to push video from BitWHIP
or other WHIP clients like [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) or [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/).

```
just run play whip
```

The WHIP client would use a URL of `http://localhost:1337/` and any Bearer Token you like. You can stream to
it via BitWHIP by running `just run stream http://localhost:1337/ bitwhip`.


### Play WHEP

Play WHEP connects to a WHEP server and plays video. Below is an example of pulling from https://b.siobud.com/ with
a Bearer Token of `bitwhip`

```
just run play-whep https://b.siobud.com/api/whep bitwhip
```

After running this open https://b.siobud.com/publish/bitwhip and your video should open in a native player.

### Stream

**Currently only Windows with NVIDIA cards are supported, more to be added**

Stream captures your local desktop and publish via WHIP. To run this you need a URL and a Bearer Token.
Below is an example of pushing to https://b.siobud.com/ with a Bearer Token of `bitwhip`

```
just run stream https://b.siobud.com/api/whip bitwhip
```

### Help

```
Usage: bitwhip [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  stream     Stream to a WHIP destination
  play-whip  Start a WHIP server that accepts incoming requests
  play-whep  Play from a WHEP destination
  help       Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -l          Force loopback candidates
  -v...       Increase log verbosity, multiple occurrences (-vvv) further increase
  -h, --help  Print help
  ```

## TODO
